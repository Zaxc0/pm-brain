  Reserved for agenda templates for sprint reviews, retrospectives, planning sessions, stakeholder readouts, etc.

  Reserved for narrative one-pagers and lightweight briefs you use to align leadership and teams on proposals and decisions.

- **2.2.4-Crisis-Management** *(placeholder)*  
  Reserved for comms playbooks and templates when things go wrong (incidents, outages, serious bugs) and you need to communicate quickly and clearly.
