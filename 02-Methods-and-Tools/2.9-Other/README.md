## 2.9 – Other Methods Overview

This domain collects supporting methods that cut across strategy, discovery, delivery, and communication.

- **2.9.1-Mental-Models**  
  Decision-making and thinking tools (e.g. pre-mortems, 60/30/10, alignment checks). Use these when you need to clarify decisions, surface risks, or align stakeholders on trade-offs.

- **2.9.2-Self-Reflection**  
  Framework for reflecting on your work, developing product sense, and catching biases. Use this after completing any framework or process to learn and improve.

As you develop additional cross-cutting methods that don't fit neatly into Strategy, Communication, or Discovery, you can add new `2.9.x-*` folders here.
