# Daily PM Execution & Rituals Guide

## Overview

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for day-to-day PM execution in large organizations. These are the "Tuesday morning" guides—practical, actionable steps for what to do right now.

## Step 0: Braindump & Assess (Critical!)

**Before setting up your routines, braindump:**
- What does your typical day look like? Dump everything - don't judge yet.
- What does your product sense tell you? What's working? What's not?
- What assumptions are you making about how you should work?
- What biases might affect your routines? (Firefighting? Meeting overload?)

**Product sense exercise:**
- If you had to be 2x more effective, what would you change?
- What would make you say "this routine is obviously wrong"?
- What would make you say "this routine is obviously right"?

-----

## Daily PM Rituals

### Your Daily Operating System

**Purpose:** Create predictable structure that prevents firefighting and ensures nothing falls through cracks.

**Time Required:** 60-90 minutes of structured time across the day

-----

### MORNING ROUTINE (30-45 minutes)

**Best Time:** First thing after coffee, before meetings

**STEP 1: Check Critical Signals (10 min)**

**In this order:**

```
☐ Production/System Health
- Check status page / monitoring dashboard
- Any incidents overnight?
- Customer-reported issues in Slack/email?

☐ Team Blockers
- Skim team Slack channel
- Any blockers raised in async updates?
- Anyone need urgent help?

☐ Stakeholder Requests
- New email from leadership
- Slack DMs from key stakeholders
- Any "urgent" flags

☐ Key Metrics
- Check your core metrics dashboard
- Any unusual changes or alerts?
- Compare to yesterday/last week
```

**Decision Point:** Is anything on fire that needs immediate attention?

- **YES →** Handle the fire (see Crisis section)
- **NO →** Continue with routine

-----

**STEP 2: Review Today’s Commitments (10 min)**

**Open your calendar and task list:**

```
☐ What meetings do I have?
- Can any be cancelled/shortened?
- What prep is needed?
- What decisions need to be made?

☐ What must get done today?
- Commitments to others
- Deadlines
- Follow-ups I promised

☐ What can wait if needed?
- Important but not urgent
- Can be delegated
- Can move to tomorrow
```

**Create today’s focus list (3-5 items max):**

```markdown
## Today: [Date]

### MUST DO (Committed)
1. [Task with time estimate and why it matters]
2. [Task with time estimate and why it matters]

### SHOULD DO (High Value)
3. [Task with time estimate]
4. [Task with time estimate]

### COULD DO (If Time)
5. [Task with time estimate]

### DELEGATE/DEFER
- [What I'm moving or giving to others]
```

-----

**STEP 3: Protect Your Focus Time (5 min)**

**Block calendar for deep work:**

- [ ] 2-hour block for focused work (protect this)
- [ ] 30-min buffer before big meetings
- [ ] 15-min breaks between back-to-back meetings

**Set boundaries:**

```
- Slack status: "🎯 Focus time until [X]"
- Close email
- Turn off notifications
- Let team know you're heads-down
```

-----

**STEP 4: Quick Team Check-In (10 min)**

**If you have a team:**

```
☐ Scan team updates (async standups, Slack)
☐ Anyone blocked? Can I unblock them now?
☐ Any celebrations or wins to acknowledge?
☐ Anyone need air cover or support?
```

**Quick Slack message to team:**

```
Morning team! 👋

Blockers I'm handling today:
- [Blocker you're working to remove]
- [Decision you're making]

Available for:
- Quick questions: Slack me
- Longer discussions: Grab time after 2pm
- Urgent stuff: Interrupt me

Focus time: 9-11am (async only unless urgent)

Let's ship it! 🚀
```

-----

**MORNING ROUTINE COMPLETE ✅**
You now know: What’s on fire, what’s due today, where you’ll focus

-----

### MIDDAY CHECK-IN (10-15 minutes)

**Best Time:** Lunch or mid-afternoon (12pm-2pm)

**STEP 1: Progress Check**

```

```

-----

**STEP 3: Quick Communication Sweep**

```
☐ Slack: Respond to anything waiting on me
☐ Email: Handle anything urgent (not full inbox zero)
☐ Calendar: Prep for afternoon meetings
☐ Team: Check if anyone needs help
```

-----

### EVENING WRAP-UP (15-20 minutes)

**Best Time:** Last 20 minutes of work day

- People to talk to
```

-----

**STEP 3: Inbox/Slack Zero Attempt (5 min)**

```
☐ Email: Get to inbox zero (or close)

```

-----

**STEP 4: Mental Reset (2 min)**

```
✅ Wins today:
- [Something you shipped or moved forward]

- [Problem you solved]

📝 Learn tomorrow:
- [What could have gone better]
- [What to do differently]

🧘 Let it go:

## 📋 2.6.4 Context Switching Guide

### Managing Multiple Initiatives

**Reality:** PMs rarely work on just one thing. You’re juggling multiple initiatives, stakeholders, and priorities.

-----

### STEP 1: Map Your Context Zones

**Identify your distinct areas of work:**

```markdown
## My Context Zones

### ZONE 1: [Project/Initiative Name]
- **Time allocation:** [X%]
- **Status:** [Phase of work]
- **Key people:** [Stakeholders]
- **Next milestone:** [Date and deliverable]

### ZONE 2: [Project/Initiative Name]
- [Same structure]

### ZONE 3: [BAU/Operations]
- **Time allocation:** [X%]
- **Includes:** Metrics reviews, team management, customer feedback

### ZONE 4: [Strategic/Future]
- **Time allocation:** [X%]
- **Includes:** Discovery, planning, stakeholder relationships
```

**Ideal split:** 70% execution, 20% operations, 10% future/strategy

-----

### STEP 2: Time Block by Context

**Don’t mix contexts in same time block**

**Example Weekly Schedule:**

```
MONDAY
- 9-11am: ZONE 1 (Project A deep work)
- 11-12pm: ZONE 3 (Metrics review, team 1-on-1s)
- 1-3pm: ZONE 2 (Project B meetings)
- 3-4pm: ZONE 3 (Inbox/Slack, admin)

TUESDAY
- 9-11am: ZONE 2 (Project B deep work)
- 11-12pm: ZONE 4 (Discovery interviews)
- 1-2pm: ZONE 1 (Project A stakeholder sync)
- 2-4pm: ZONE 1 (Project A work)

[Continue for week]
```

**Benefits:**

- Reduces context switching cost
- Allows deeper focus
- Makes saying no easier (“That’s not my focus today”)

-----

### STEP 3: Create Context Switching Rituals

**Between contexts, take 5-10 minutes:**

**CLOSE previous context:**

```
☐ Capture open loops (write down where you left off)
☐ Document next steps
☐ Close related tabs/documents
☐ Clear mental state
```

**OPEN next context:**

```
☐ Review where you left off
☐ Check priority for this context
☐ Open relevant documents
☐ Set intention (what you want to accomplish)
```

**Example ritual:**

```
Closing Project A:
- Save current work
- Write "Next: Review design mocks" in task
- Close Figma, Slack channels
- Take 2-minute break

Opening Project B:
- Read yesterday's notes
- Check "Today's focus" for Project B
- Open PRD and Jira
- Set timer for 90-min focus block
```

-----

### STEP 4: Triage Interruptions

**When something urgent comes up:**

**Interrupt Decision Tree:**

```
Is this actually urgent?
└─ NO → Add to appropriate context zone, handle later
└─ YES → Ask: Can it wait until my next context switch?
└─ YES → Schedule for next appropriate time block
└─ NO → Handle now, but:
1. Close current context properly
2. Handle interruption
3. Decide: Return to previous context or move on?
```

**Response templates:**

**“Not urgent”:**

> “Adding this to my [Project X] time tomorrow. Will update you by EOD tomorrow.”

**“Can wait 2 hours”:**

> “I’m in focused work until 2pm. Can we discuss at 2:15? If it can’t wait, let me know and I’ll switch contexts.”

**“Truly urgent”:**

> “On it. Give me 5 min to wrap what I’m doing, then I’m fully on this.”

-----

### STEP 5: Protect Your Focus Time

**Daily focus time (non-negotiable):**

```
☐ 2-3 hours blocked daily
☐ Clearly marked on calendar
☐ Slack status: "🎯 Focus time"
☐ Phone on Do Not Disturb
☐ Email closed
☐ Slack muted (except DMs from manager)
```

**When someone tries to book over it:**

> “I have focus time blocked then. I have [other time] available. If it’s truly urgent, I can move focus time to [alternate time].”

-----

### STEP 6: Weekly Context Review

**Friday afternoon (15 min):**

```markdown
## Context Review - Week of [Date]

### TIME ALLOCATION (Actual)
- Zone 1 (Project A): [X%] (Target: [Y%])
- Zone 2 (Project B): [X%] (Target: [Y%])
- Zone 3 (Operations): [X%] (Target: [Y%])
- Zone 4 (Strategy): [X%] (Target: [Y%])
- Interruptions: [X%]

### ASSESSMENT
✅ What worked well this week?
❌ What didn't work?
🔄 What to adjust next week?

### NEXT WEEK ALLOCATION
Based on priorities, adjust time blocks:
- [Context]: [X%] because [reason]
```

-----

## 🎯 Common Daily Scenarios

### Scenario: Everything Feels Urgent

**When your day is all firefighting:**

**STEP 1: Triage (10 minutes)**

```
List everything that feels urgent:
1. [Item]
2. [Item]
3. [Item]

For each, ask:
- Urgent AND Important? → Do now
- Urgent, NOT Important? → Delegate or defer
- Important, NOT Urgent? → Schedule properly
- Neither? → Delete/ignore

Reality check:
- Does this need MY attention?
- Could someone else handle it?
- What happens if I don't do this today?
```

**STEP 2: Create forcing function**

```
Pick ONE thing that MUST happen today:
[THE ONE THING]

Everything else is secondary.

Why this one thing?
- [Impact if done]
- [Cost if not done]

Time block: [X-Y] - No meetings, no interruptions
```

-----

### Scenario: Stuck and Don’t Know What to Do Next

**When you’re paralyzed by ambiguity:**

**STEP 1: Externalize (5 minutes)**

Write out:

```
What I'm trying to accomplish:
[Goal]

Why I'm stuck:
[The blocker or uncertainty]

What I don't know:
[Specific unknowns]

What I do know:
[What's clear]
```

**STEP 2: Find one action (5 minutes)**

```
Even if I don't know the answer, I could:
- [ ] Talk to [person] who might know
- [ ] Research [specific thing]
- [ ] Try [small experiment]
- [ ] Document [what I know so far]
- [ ] Ask [stakeholder] for guidance

The smallest possible next step:
[ONE concrete action, 30 min or less]
```

**STEP 3: Take the step**

Do the smallest next action. Progress creates momentum.

-----

### Scenario: Meeting-Filled Day, No Focus Time

**When calendar is 100% booked:**

**Options:**

**A) Block morning before meetings start**

```
- Come in 1 hour early OR
- Block 8-10am for focus (move first meeting)
```

**B) Use between-meeting gaps**

```
30-min gap between meetings:
- 5 min: Context switch
- 20 min: Focused micro-task
- 5 min: Prep for next meeting
```

**C) Protect next day**

```
Today is lost to meetings.
Block 50% of tomorrow for focus work.
Accept today as a meeting day.
```

**D) Cancel/shorten meetings**

```
"I need to reschedule our 1:1 to protect focus time.
Does [other time] work?"

or

"Can we do 30 min instead of 60? I can cover [key points]."
```
