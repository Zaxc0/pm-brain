## How to Use This Framework

### Step 0: Braindump & Assess (Critical!)

**Before setting up your routines, braindump:**
- What does your typical day look like? Dump everything - don't judge yet.
- What does your product sense tell you? What's working? What's not?
- What assumptions are you making about how you should work?
- What biases might affect your routines? (Firefighting? Meeting overload?)

**Product sense exercise:**
- If you had to be 2x more effective, what would you change?
- What would make you say "this routine is obviously wrong"?
- What would make you say "this routine is obviously right"?

### Step 1: Review Framework
Read `1-daily-framework.md` to understand daily, weekly, and monthly rituals

### Step 2: Customize for Your Context
Adapt the routines to your specific role and organization

### Step 3: Set Up Systems
Create the tracking and planning systems you need

### Step 4: Start with Daily Routine
Implement the daily routine first, then add weekly/monthly

### Step 5: Iterate and Improve
Adjust routines based on what works and what doesn't

### Step 6: Self-Reflection
Regularly reflect on your execution effectiveness:
- What's working well?
- What needs improvement?
- How can you be more effective?
