# Mental Models Framework

## Introduction

This framework contains essential mental models and decision-making tools for product managers. These are complementary to the process frameworks (2.1-2.10) and help with strategic thinking, team alignment, and navigating common product challenges.

**When to use mental models:**
- Strategic decision-making and prioritization
- Team alignment and conflict resolution
- Understanding different perspectives in product discussions
- Risk assessment and planning
- Matching decision speed to reversibility

**When process frameworks are better:**
- Structured workflows (discovery, validation, PRD writing)
- Step-by-step processes with templates
- Evidence-based research and validation
- Document creation and execution

- `1-mental-models.md` — Complete mental models collection including Pre-mortems, 60-30-10, 3 Levels, 0-1 vs 1-100, One-Way/Two-Way Doors, Alignment Check, and Assumptions Framework

## How to Use This Framework

1. **Strategic Planning**: Use 60-30-10 framework for roadmap allocation
2. **Risk Assessment**: Use Pre-mortems to identify project risks early
3. **Team Alignment**: Use Alignment Check and Assumptions Framework when teams disagree
4. **Decision Speed**: Use One-Way vs Two-Way Doors to match process to risk
5. **Stage Recognition**: Use 0-1 vs 1-100 to adapt team structure and metrics

## How to Maintain

- **After Major Decisions**: Document which mental models were used
- **Quarterly Reviews**: Review effectiveness of mental models in decision-making
- **Team Feedback**: Gather feedback on which models are most useful
