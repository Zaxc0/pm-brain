# Self-Reflection Framework

## Overview

Self-reflection helps you develop product sense, catch biases, and learn from experience. This framework provides structured prompts to help you think critically about your work and decisions.

**Purpose:** Build self-awareness and improve product judgment through regular reflection.

## Core Principles

### 1. Reflect Regularly
- After completing frameworks or processes
- After major decisions
- Weekly/monthly personal retrospectives
- When things don't go as expected

### 2. Be Honest
- Acknowledge mistakes and biases
- Don't rationalize failures
- Celebrate learnings, not just successes

### 3. Focus on Product Sense
- How did your intuition guide you?
- What did your product sense tell you?
- How can you develop better judgment?

### 4. Catch Biases
- What biases affected your thinking?
- How did you catch them (or miss them)?
- What will you watch for next time?

## Reflection Prompts

### After Using Any Framework

**What did you learn?**
- What surprised you?
- What did you expect that didn't happen?
- What didn't you expect that did happen?

**How did your thinking evolve?**
- How did your initial braindump compare to your final output?
- What changed your mind? Why?
- What assumptions were wrong? Right?

**Product sense development:**
- What did your product sense tell you? Was it right?
- What would great product sense notice that you missed?
- How can you develop better judgment?

**Bias awareness:**
- What biases affected your thinking? (Confirmation? Solution? Sunk cost?)
- How did you catch them (or miss them)?
- What will you watch for next time?

**What would you do differently?**
- If you did this again, what would you change?
- What would you do the same?
- What's your biggest takeaway?

### After Strategic Work

**Strategic thinking:**
- Did you focus on outcomes or solutions?
- How did you balance short-term vs. long-term?
- What strategic trade-offs did you make? Were they right?

**Stakeholder management:**
- How did you balance different stakeholder needs?
- What conflicts did you navigate? How?
- What would you do differently in stakeholder management?

### After Discovery Work

**Customer understanding:**
- How did your understanding of customers evolve?
- What surprised you about customer needs?
- What biases affected your customer research?

**Evidence vs. assumptions:**
- What did you assume that turned out wrong?
- What evidence changed your mind?
- How can you gather better evidence next time?

### After Validation Work

**Risk assessment:**
- What risks did you identify? Miss?
- How did validation change your confidence?
- What would you validate differently?

**Decision-making:**
- How did you use evidence to make decisions?
- What would you decide differently with hindsight?
- What decision criteria worked? Didn't work?

## Product Sense Exercises

### Exercise 1: Gut Check Reflection
- What did your gut tell you at the start?
- Was your gut right or wrong? Why?
- How can you develop better intuition?

### Exercise 2: Expert PM Perspective
- What would an experienced PM notice that you missed?
- What would they do differently?
- How can you develop that perspective?

### Exercise 3: Bias Audit
- List all biases that might have affected you
- Which ones did you catch? Which did you miss?
- What will you watch for next time?

### Exercise 4: Product Taste Development
- What feels "right" or "wrong" about your work? Why?
- How can you develop better product taste?
- What examples of great product sense can you learn from?

## How to Use This Framework

### Step 1: Set Aside Time
- 15-30 minutes after completing work
- Weekly 30-minute reflection sessions
- Monthly deeper reflection (1-2 hours)

### Step 2: Choose Relevant Prompts
- Pick prompts that match what you just did
- Don't try to answer everything - focus on what matters
- Be honest and specific

### Step 3: Write It Down
- Use the reflection template or just free-form
- Capture learnings while they're fresh
- Review past reflections to see patterns

### Step 4: Act on Learnings
- What will you do differently next time?
- What patterns do you notice across reflections?
- How are you developing as a PM?

## Common Reflection Patterns

**Pattern: "I assumed X but Y happened"**
- Learning: Challenge assumptions earlier
- Action: Add assumption-checking to your process

**Pattern: "My product sense told me X and I was right/wrong"**
- Learning: Develop intuition through experience
- Action: Track when your gut is right vs. wrong

**Pattern: "I fell into bias X again"**
- Learning: This bias is a blind spot for you
- Action: Add specific bias-checking to your process

**Pattern: "I didn't braindump first and jumped to structure"**
- Learning: Braindumping helps you think better
- Action: Always braindump before structuring

## LLM Helper Prompts

Use this prompt with AI tools to help you reflect:

```markdown
Act as a product management coach helping me reflect on my work. Your role is to help me think, not to think for me.

1) Ask me to describe what I just did:
- What framework or process did I complete?
- What was the outcome?
- What went well? What didn't?

2) Help me reflect:
- "What did you learn? What surprised you?"
- "How did your thinking evolve from your initial braindump?"
- "What does your product sense tell you about what happened?"
- "What biases affected your thinking? How did you catch them (or miss them)?"

3) Help me develop product sense:
- "What would an experienced PM notice that you missed?"
- "What would great product sense look like here?"
- "How can you develop better judgment?"

4) Help me plan improvements:
- "What will you do differently next time?"
- "What patterns do you notice across your reflections?"
- "How are you developing as a PM?"

I'll start by telling you what I just worked on.
```
