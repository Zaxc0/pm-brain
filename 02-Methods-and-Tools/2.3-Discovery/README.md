## 2.3 – Discovery Methods Overview

This domain contains methods for understanding customers, framing opportunities, and validating ideas.

- **2.3.1-Research-Interviews**  
  Interview guide and best practices. Use this before and during interviews to avoid bias, ask better questions, and capture richer stories.

- **2.3.2-Continuous-Discovery-Habits**  
  End-to-end discovery flow: create interview snapshots, synthesize patterns, create opportunities, and generate solutions. Use this when you want a repeatable weekly discovery rhythm.

- **2.3.3-Jobs-To-Be-Done**  
  Framework for capturing jobs, outcomes, and context. Use this when you need to reframe solution requests into underlying jobs and desired progress.

- **2.3.4-Idea-Validation**  
  Framework for reducing risk before build (RAT-style validation). Use this when stakeholders say “prove it” and you need a minimal test plan for desirability, usability, feasibility, or viability.

Typical flow: **Research-Interviews → Continuous-Discovery-Habits → JTBD (optional/parallel) → Idea-Validation → Strategy/Delivery**.
