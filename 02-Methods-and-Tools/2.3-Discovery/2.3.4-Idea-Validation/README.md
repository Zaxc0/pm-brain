# Idea Validation Framework

## Introduction

Use this framework to systematically validate product ideas before significant investment, reducing risk and increasing success rates. The RAT (Riskiest Assumption Test) approach helps you test assumptions with minimal investment.

**When to use validation:**
- Before building significant features or products
- When stakeholders ask "prove it" before investment
- Testing desirability, usability, feasibility, or viability risks
- Reducing uncertainty before committing resources

**When validation might not be needed:**
- Very small experiments (<1 week effort)
- Well-validated problems with proven solutions
- Technical spikes where feasibility is the only risk

## How to Use This Framework

1. **Form Hypotheses**: Identify your riskiest assumptions (Desirability, Usability, Feasibility, Viability)
2. **Design Tests**: Create lightweight experiments to test each assumption
3. **Set Thresholds**: Define clear pass/fail criteria before running tests
4. **Run Tests**: Execute experiments and collect evidence
5. **Make Decisions**: Use evidence to decide Proceed/Pivot/Re-test/Stop

## How to Maintain

- **During Validation**: Update confidence levels as you learn
- **After Tests**: Document results and decisions in decision log
- **Quarterly Reviews**: Review validation effectiveness and adjust approach
