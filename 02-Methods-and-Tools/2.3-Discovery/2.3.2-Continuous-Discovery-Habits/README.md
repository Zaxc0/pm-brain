# Continuous Discovery Habits Framework

## Introduction

Use these templates to conduct systematic customer discovery interviews and synthesize insights into actionable opportunities and solutions. This framework helps you move from raw customer conversations to validated product opportunities.

**When to use this framework:**
- Conducting customer interviews and user research
- Synthesizing patterns from multiple interviews
- Identifying product opportunities from research
- Generating solution concepts based on discovered needs

**When discovery might not be needed:**
- Well-understood problems with existing solutions
- Technical infrastructure work with no customer impact
- Very early exploration before clear problem space exists
