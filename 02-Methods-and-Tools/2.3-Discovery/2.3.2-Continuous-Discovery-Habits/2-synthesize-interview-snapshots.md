# Synthesizing Customer Interview Insights (Continuous Discovery Habits)

## Goal
Combine insights from multiple customer interviews to identify patterns, validate or challenge assumptions, and create actionable recommendations that inform product decisions and opportunity prioritization.

## Output
- **Format:** Markdown (`.md`)
- **Location:** `03-Research-Artifacts/3.1-User-Interviews/synthesis/`
- **Filename:** `synthesis-[research-theme]-[YYYY-MM-DD].md`

## Process
1. **Collect Interview Snapshots:** Gather all relevant interview snapshots from research period
2. **Pattern Identification:** Look for recurring themes, behaviors, and needs across interviews
3. **Segment Analysis:** Identify differences between customer segments or use cases
4. **Assumption Validation:** Check which hypotheses were confirmed, refuted, or require more data
5. **Opportunity Mapping:** Connect patterns to potential product opportunities
6. **Insight Prioritization:** Rank findings by strength of evidence and business impact
7. **Recommendation Development:** Create actionable next steps based on findings
8. **Stakeholder Communication:** Prepare findings for team and leadership sharing

## Synthesis Principles

### Strong Pattern Evidence
- **Multiple sources:** Theme appears across 3+ different customers
- **Consistent stories:** Similar underlying needs despite different contexts
- **Behavioral evidence:** Patterns in what people do, not just what they say
- **Cross-segment validation:** Theme appears across different customer types

### Weak Pattern Evidence
- **Single source:** Only one customer mentioned this
- **Contradictory evidence:** Mixed signals across interviews
- **Hypothetical responses:** Based on "what if" rather than actual behavior
- **Interviewer bias:** Leading questions may have influenced responses

### Synthesis Quality Standards
- **Evidence-based:** Every insight backed by specific interview quotes/stories
- **Balanced view:** Include both confirming and disconfirming evidence
- **Customer language:** Use customer terminology, not internal jargon
- **Actionable insights:** Connect findings to specific next steps
