# Creating Opportunities from Customer Insights (Continuous Discovery Habits)

## Goal
Transform customer insights from interview snapshots into clear, evidence-based opportunities that represent unmet customer needs and can guide product development decisions.

## Output
- **Format:** Markdown (`.md`)
- **Location:** `03-Research-Artifacts/3.1-User-Interviews/opportunities/`
- **Filename:** `opportunity-[brief-description]-[YYYY-MM-DD].md`

## Process
1. **Review Interview Evidence:** Analyze multiple interview snapshots for patterns
2. **Identify Customer Need Patterns:** Look for recurring themes across different customers
3. **Frame as Opportunities:** Express patterns as "How might we..." statements
4. **Validate with Evidence:** Ensure each opportunity is backed by specific customer stories
5. **Assess Opportunity Size:** Estimate breadth and depth of customer impact
6. **Connect to Business Outcomes:** Link opportunities to measurable business results
7. **Document Opportunity:** Create structured opportunity document
8. **Share for Feedback:** Circulate with team for validation and prioritization

## Opportunity Identification Principles
**Strong opportunities have:**
- **Multiple customer evidence:** Supported by stories from 3+ different customers
- **Clear unmet need:** Specific problem customers are trying to solve
- **Current workarounds:** Customers are cobbling together solutions
- **Measurable impact:** Can connect to business metrics or customer success
- **Actionable scope:** Specific enough to generate targeted solutions

**Weak opportunities:**
- **Single source:** Only one customer mentioned this
- **Feature requests:** Customers asking for specific features vs. expressing needs
- **Edge cases:** Problems only affecting very specific, uncommon scenarios
- **Vague statements:** Too broad or abstract to act upon
- **Already solved:** Existing solutions adequately address the need

## Opportunity Validation Framework
Before documenting, ask:
- **Evidence:** What specific customer stories support this opportunity?
- **Frequency:** How many customers experience this need?
- **Intensity:** How painful is this problem for customers?
- **Workarounds:** What are customers doing today to solve this?
- **Business Impact:** How does solving this connect to business outcomes?
