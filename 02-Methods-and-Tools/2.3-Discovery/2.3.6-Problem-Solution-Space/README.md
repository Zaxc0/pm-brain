# Problem-Solution Space Exploration Framework

## Introduction

This framework helps product teams systematically explore ambiguous problems and generate multiple solution options before committing to building. Problem-solution space exploration is NOT about finding the quickest answer—it's about finding the RIGHT answer.

## How to Use This Framework

### Step 0: Braindump & Explore (Critical!)

**Before starting exploration, braindump:**
- What problem are you trying to solve? Dump everything - don't structure yet.
- What does your product sense tell you? What feels like the real problem?
- What assumptions are you making? List them explicitly.
- What biases might affect your exploration? (Solution bias? Jumping to solutions?)

**Product sense exercise:**
- If you had to explain this problem to a 5-year-old, what would you say?
- What would make you say "we're solving the wrong problem"?
- What would make you say "we're solving the right problem"?

### Step 1: Review Framework
Read `1-problem-solution-space-framework.md` to understand exploration methods

### Step 2: Choose Your Approach
Select Double Diamond, Opportunity Solution Tree, or both based on your needs

### Step 3: Explore Problem Space
Use discovery methods to understand the problem deeply

### Step 4: Define the Problem
Synthesize insights into a clear problem statement

### Step 5: Generate Solutions
Create multiple diverse solutions for the defined problem

### Step 6: Test and Select
Validate solutions with users and select the best option

### Step 7: Self-Reflection
After exploration, reflect:
- How did your understanding evolve?
- What surprised you?
- What would you do differently?

## When to Use

- Starting a new product or major feature
- Ambiguous problems needing exploration
- Multiple solution options to evaluate
- Need to align team on problem definition

## How to Maintain

- **During Exploration**: Document learnings and update opportunity/solution maps
- **After Selection**: Archive exploration artifacts for future reference
- **Quarterly Review**: Review exploration effectiveness and improve process
