# Jobs To Be Done Framework

## Introduction

Use this framework to understand the underlying jobs customers hire your product to do, focusing on progress rather than demographics. JTBD helps you understand why customers choose your product and what progress they're trying to make.

**When to use JTBD:**
- Understanding why customers choose your product over alternatives
- Reframing feature requests as customer progress
- Identifying unmet customer needs
- Designing solutions centered on customer jobs

**When JTBD might not be needed:**
- Technical infrastructure work with no direct customer impact
- Internal tooling where the "job" is obvious
- Very early exploration before customer understanding exists

## How to Use This Framework

1. **Identify the Job**: Understand what progress customers are trying to make
2. **Map Job Context**: Document when, where, and why the job arises
3. **Understand Alternatives**: Research what customers currently hire to get the job done
4. **Define Job Success**: Determine how customers measure successful job completion
5. **Design for Progress**: Create solutions that enable the desired progress

## How to Maintain

- **After Interviews**: Update job stories as you learn more from customer research
- **Quarterly Reviews**: Reassess whether you're helping customers make progress
- **After Launches**: Validate that solutions enable job completion
