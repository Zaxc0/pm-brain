# 2.3.1 Roadmap Framework

## Overview

This framework helps product managers create roadmaps that effectively communicate product direction while maintaining the flexibility needed for successful product development.

## Core Philosophy

### Roadmaps are NOT Commitments

A roadmap is a strategic communication tool, not a project plan. It should:

- **Enable agility over rigidity** - Market conditions and user feedback can shift priorities
- **Prevent stakeholder misalignment** - Clear communication prevents overpromising
- **Encourage data-driven decisions** - Teams can pivot based on new insights
- **Reduce team pressure** - Realistic expectations improve morale and sustainability

### Confidence-Based Planning

Different time horizons require different approaches:

- **NOW (0-3 months)** - High confidence, specific deliverables
- **NEXT (3-9 months)** - Medium confidence, outcome targets
- **LATER (9-18+ months)** - Low confidence, strategic themes

## Framework Structure

### 1. Header Section

Always include:
- **Disclaimer** - "This roadmap is not a commitment"
- **Last updated date**
- **Next review date**
- **Confidence level legend**

### 2. NOW Section (High Confidence 70-90%)

**Use when:**
- Requirements are well-defined
- Dependencies are minimal
- Team capacity is allocated

**Structure:**
- Initiative name (action-oriented)
- Target outcome (business value)
- Success metrics (measurable)
- Dependencies (external needs)

### 3. NEXT Section (Medium Confidence 40-70%)

**Use when:**
- General direction is clear
- Some scope uncertainty exists
- Dependencies are manageable

**Structure:**
- Same as NOW section
- Add "Key Assumptions" column

### 4. LATER Section (Low Confidence 10-40%)

**Use when:**
- Exploring opportunities
- High uncertainty exists
- Significant research needed

**Structure:**
- Theme (broad direction)
- Strategic goal (long-term vision)
- Potential outcomes (directional)
- Research needed (what to learn)

## Writing Guidelines

### Initiative Names
- ✅ "Improve onboarding flow for new teams"
- ❌ "Onboarding project"

### Target Outcomes
- ✅ "Reduce onboarding time by 20%"
- ❌ "Make onboarding nicer"

### Success Metrics
- ✅ "Increase weekly active teams by 15%"
- ❌ "Better team engagement"

### Dependencies
- External teams
- Market data providers
- Regulatory approvals
- Technical infrastructure

## Review Schedule

### Weekly Updates (NOW items)
- Progress against success metrics
- Dependency status updates
- Scope adjustments based on learnings

### Monthly Reviews (NOW section)
- Full review of current initiatives
- Confidence level adjustments
- Market impact assessment

### Quarterly Reviews (All sections)
- Complete roadmap refresh
- Strategic priority adjustments
- Capacity allocation changes

### Annual Reviews
- Strategic theme evaluation
- Long-term capacity planning
- Stakeholder alignment sessions

## Stakeholder Communication

### For Leadership
- Focus on outcomes and strategic themes
- Emphasize confidence levels and assumptions
- Highlight dependencies needing executive support

### For Engineering Teams
- Provide detailed technical context
- Clear dependency mapping
- Regular scope and timeline discussions

### For Business Users
- Connect initiatives to business performance
- Explain confidence levels and market factors
- Provide scenario planning based on conditions

### For Compliance/Legal
- Share compliance-related outcomes
- Communicate timelines with regulatory caveats
- Focus on risk mitigation

## Common Challenges and Solutions

### "When exactly will X be ready?"
**Response pattern:**
"Feature X is part of [Initiative] aimed at [Outcome]. Based on our [Confidence Level], we expect to achieve [Outcome] by [Time Range]. What specific needs do you have that this outcome would address?"

### "Why can't you commit to dates?"
**Response pattern:**
"We prioritize delivering value over hitting arbitrary dates. Our confidence levels help you plan appropriately. What decisions are you trying to make that would be affected by this timeline?"

### "The roadmap keeps changing!"
**Response pattern:**
"Changes mean we're building the right capabilities for current conditions. Let's focus on whether [Outcome] is still the most valuable goal for your needs."

### "How do external factors affect timelines?"
**Response pattern:**
"External factors are included in our confidence levels. [Initiative] has [Confidence Level] which accounts for [External Factor]. We'll adjust if conditions change significantly."

## Best Practices

### Do's
- Update regularly (weekly for NOW, monthly for NEXT/LATER)
- Focus on outcomes over outputs
- Use clear, measurable success criteria
- Maintain appropriate confidence levels
- Communicate assumptions transparently

### Don'ts
- Promise specific delivery dates beyond 3 months
- Include every small feature or bug fix
- Use technical jargon without context
- Hide dependencies or risks
- Let the roadmap become stale

## Metrics for Success

Track these roadmap effectiveness metrics:

- **Stakeholder satisfaction** - Regular feedback surveys
- **Prediction accuracy** - How often NOW items deliver on time
- **Strategic alignment** - Percentage of delivered outcomes supporting business goals
- **Communication effectiveness** - Reduction in timeline clarification requests

## Templates and Tools

- Use the provided template in `2-roadmap-template.md`
- Consider tools like simple spreadsheets, post-its, Confluence or JIRA Product Discovery
- Maintain version control for roadmap updates
- Archive old versions for retrospective analysis
