# 2.3 Roadmap Framework

## Introduction

A comprehensive framework for creating stakeholder-friendly product roadmaps that balance transparency with flexibility. Roadmaps communicate strategic direction while maintaining the agility needed for successful product development.

**When to use this framework:**
- Creating quarterly or annual product roadmaps
- Communicating product plans to stakeholders
- Managing expectations around delivery timelines
- Balancing strategic vision with tactical execution

**When roadmaps might not be needed:**
- Very early discovery phases before clear direction emerges
- One-off projects with fixed scope and timeline
- Internal tooling with no external stakeholders

## Files

- **2.3.1-roadmap-framework.md** - Complete framework with philosophy, structure, and best practices
- **2.3.2-roadmap-template.md** - Ready-to-use template with examples

## How to Use This Framework

1. **Copy Template**: Start with `2.3.2-roadmap-template.md`
2. **Fill Time Horizons**: Add initiatives to NOW, NEXT, and LATER sections
3. **Set Confidence Levels**: Use appropriate confidence (🟢🟡🔴) based on certainty
4. **Share with Stakeholders**: Use communication guide for different audiences
5. **Schedule Reviews**: Set up weekly/monthly/quarterly review cadence

## How to Maintain

- **Weekly Updates**: Update NOW section with progress and dependency status
- **Monthly Reviews**: Full review of NOW section, adjust confidence levels
- **Quarterly Reviews**: Complete roadmap refresh, move items between time horizons
- **After Major Changes**: Update when strategic priorities or market conditions change

## Key Principles

1. **Roadmaps are not commitments** - They reflect current priorities but adapt to market changes
2. **Confidence-based planning** - Different time horizons require different confidence levels
3. **Outcome-focused** - Emphasize business value over feature delivery
4. **Living document** - Regular updates keep roadmaps relevant and useful
