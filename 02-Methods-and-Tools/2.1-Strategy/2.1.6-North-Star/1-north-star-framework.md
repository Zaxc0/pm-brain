# North Star Framework

## Overview

This framework helps product teams align around a single metric that captures customer value and drives sustainable growth. The North Star Framework is NOT a project plan or feature list—it's a strategic alignment tool.

## Step 0: Braindump & Product Sense (Do this first!)

**Before defining your North Star, braindump:**
- What outcomes are you trying to achieve? Dump everything - don't structure yet.
- What does your product sense tell you? What metric feels like it captures real value?
- What assumptions are you making? List them explicitly.
- What biases might affect your metric choice? (Vanity metrics? Activity vs. outcome?)
- What would great product sense look like here? What would an experienced PM focus on?

**Product sense exercise:**
- If you had to pick ONE metric that represents customer value, what would it be? Why?
- What would make you say "this North Star is obviously wrong"?
- What would make you say "this North Star is obviously right"?

## Core Philosophy

### The North Star Framework is NOT a Silver Bullet

A North Star Framework is a living document that should:

- **Enable customer-centricity over vanity metrics** - Focus on value delivered, not just activity
- **Drive cross-functional alignment** - Everyone understands how their work connects to growth
- **Encourage strategic focus** - Teams prioritize work that moves the metric
- **Reduce organizational friction** - Clear metrics prevent endless debates

### Three Types of Product “Games”

Choose the game your product is playing:

- **ATTENTION** - Users return frequently (social media, content platforms)
- **TRANSACTION** - Users complete purchases (e-commerce, marketplaces)
- **PRODUCTIVITY** - Users accomplish tasks efficiently (SaaS, tools)

## Framework Structure

### 1. Header Section

Always include:

- **Disclaimer** - “This North Star reflects our current strategy and may evolve”
- **Product game** - Which game are you playing?
- **Last updated date**
- **Next review date**

### 2. North Star Metric (The “What”)

**Use when:**

- You can measure it consistently
- It represents customer value delivered
- It connects to business outcomes
- Teams can explain how their work impacts it

**Structure:**

- Metric name (customer-value focused)
- Definition (precise and measurable)
- Why this metric (connects value to growth)
- Current baseline

### 3. Input Metrics (The “How”)

**Use when:**

- Teams can directly influence them
- They’re leading indicators of the North Star
- You have 3-5 key inputs (not more)
- Each maps to team capabilities

**Structure:**

- Input name (action-oriented)
- How it influences North Star
- Owning team
- Current value and target

### 4. Work Connections (The “Execution”)

**Use when:**

- Initiatives clearly move an input
- You can define success criteria
- Teams need prioritization clarity

**Structure:**

- Initiative or bet
- Which input it moves
- Expected impact
- How you’ll measure success

## Writing Guidelines

### North Star Metric Names

- ✅ “Weekly Learning Users” (Amplitude)
- ✅ “Messages sent per week” (Slack)
- ✅ “Nights booked” (Airbnb)
- ❌ “Total registered users”
- ❌ “Page views”

### Input Metrics

- ✅ “New user activation rate within first session”
- ✅ “Percentage of users discovering personalized content”
- ❌ “Users who saw the onboarding flow”
- ❌ “Feature adoption”

### Why This Metric

- ✅ “Measures value exchange between users”
- ✅ “Predicts retention and expansion”
- ❌ “It’s easy to measure”
- ❌ “Our competitors use it”

## Review Schedule

### Weekly Check-ins (Input Metrics)

- Progress against input targets
- Early signals and trends
- Blockers and adjustments

### Monthly Reviews (North Star + Inputs)

- Full metric review
- Initiative performance
- Strategic recalibration

### Quarterly Deep-Dives (Full Framework)

- North Star Metric validity check
- Input metric relevance
- New opportunities or threats
- Capacity and resource alignment

### Annual Reviews

- Product strategy alignment
- Market positioning check
- Consider North Star changes

## Stakeholder Communication

### For Leadership

- Focus on North Star and business correlation
- Highlight strategic bets and trade-offs
- Show how inputs drive sustainable growth

### For Product Teams

- Emphasize inputs they can directly influence
- Connect daily work to North Star movement
- Celebrate wins and share learnings

### For Cross-Functional Teams

- Show how their function contributes
- Provide clear success criteria
- Explain interdependencies

### For Individual Contributors

- Make the connection personal: “My work → Input → North Star → Customer value”
- Share impact stories regularly
- Create feedback loops

## Common Challenges and Solutions

### “This metric doesn’t capture everything we do”

**Response pattern:**
“You’re right—no single metric can. That’s why we have inputs that break down how we deliver value. What aspect of customer value do you think we’re missing?”

### “Can’t we just track everything?”

**Response pattern:**
“Tracking everything means focusing on nothing. Our North Star and inputs help us make trade-offs. What decision are you trying to make that requires additional metrics?”

### “My work doesn’t impact the North Star”

**Response pattern:**
“Let’s map it together. What outcome does your work enable? How does that connect to one of our inputs? If we can’t draw the connection, we should discuss priorities.”

### “The metric isn’t moving despite our efforts”

**Response pattern:**
“Let’s examine our beliefs. Do our inputs actually drive the North Star? Are we measuring the right things? This is exactly when the framework helps us learn and adapt.”

## Best Practices

### Do’s

- Start with customer value, not business goals
- Keep inputs between 3-5 (focus matters)
- Revisit and refine regularly
- Celebrate input movement, not just North Star
- Use workshops for definition and alignment
- Tell stories of how work connects to impact

### Don’ts

- Don’t choose vanity metrics as your North Star
- Don’t create North Stars for every team (one product = one North Star)
- Don’t set and forget—it requires cultivation
- Don’t skip the input metrics (they’re how teams act)
- Don’t ignore qualitative insights
- Don’t expect perfection on day one

## Metrics for Framework Success

Track these to know if your framework is working:

- **Alignment** - Can everyone explain the North Star and their contribution?
- **Prioritization clarity** - Fewer debates about “what to work on next”
- **Strategic decisions** - Features evaluated against North Star impact
- **Team autonomy** - Teams make better local decisions
- **Learning velocity** - Faster insight to action cycles

## Workshop Facilitation

### 90-120 Minute North Star Workshop

**Preparation:**

- Select 5-10 key contributors (product, engineering, data, design, business)
- Share pre-read on North Star Framework basics
- Gather existing metrics and strategy docs

**Agenda:**

**Part 1: Alignment (20 min)**

- Review product strategy and vision
- Discuss customer value proposition
- Identify which “game” you’re playing

**Part 2: North Star Candidates (30 min)**

- Brainstorm potential North Star Metrics
- Apply criteria: customer value, measurable, actionable, connected to revenue
- Narrow to top 2-3 candidates

**Part 3: Input Mapping (30 min)**

- For each North Star candidate, identify 3-5 inputs
- Discuss which inputs teams can influence
- Map inputs to team capabilities

**Part 4: Selection & Definition (20 min)**

- Choose North Star Metric
- Write clear definitions
- Define measurement approach

**Part 5: Next Steps (10 min)**

- Assign owners
- Set review cadence
- Plan rollout communication

### Anti-Workshop: Bad North Star Exercise

Spend 10 minutes brainstorming what a TERRIBLE North Star would be for your company. This frees thinking and sets guardrails:

- What metrics would make us feel good but deliver no value?
- What could we optimize that would hurt customers?
- What's easy to measure but meaningless?
