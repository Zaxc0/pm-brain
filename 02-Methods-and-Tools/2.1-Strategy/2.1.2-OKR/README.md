# OKR Framework

## Introduction

This framework helps you create and manage Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) that align teams around measurable outcomes. OKRs operationalize strategy into actionable goals that connect daily work to business results.

## How to Use This Framework

1. **Review Framework**: Read `2.2.1-okr-framework.md` to understand OKR principles and process
2. **Use Templates**: Start with templates from `2.2.2-okr-template.md` to draft your OKRs
3. **Set Objectives**: Create 1-2 objectives per team with 2-4 key results each
4. **Track Progress**: Use weekly check-ins to update confidence and progress
5. **Review Quarterly**: Grade results at end of cycle and set next cycle
