## 2.1 – Strategy Methods Overview

This domain contains the core strategy methods you use to set direction, translate it into plans, and specify work.

- **2.1.1-Product-Strategy**  
  Sets strategic direction. Use this when you need to go from vision → 3–5 strategic pillars, with clear non-goals and rationale. Includes full guide + working templates (strategy sprint, strategy doc, rollout plan, leadership interviews, etc.).

- **2.1.2-OKR**  
  Operationalizes strategy into Objectives and Key Results. Use this to design OKRs, evaluate them, and connect them back to strategic pillars.

- **2.1.3-Roadmap**  
  Turns strategy and OKRs into a time-phased plan. Use this to define NOW/NEXT/LATER, evaluate roadmap health, and communicate plans.

- **2.1.4-PRD**  
  Specifies what to build. Use this to write product requirements (classic and JTBD-flavoured PRDs) once a problem/opportunity is validated.

- **2.1.5-Personas**  
  Describes who you’re building for. Use this to define personas and templates that connect directly to your product strategy and roadmap.

- **2.1.6-North-Star** *(placeholder)*  
  Reserved for methods & templates to define and maintain your north-star metric and supporting metric tree.

- **2.1.7-Prioritization** *(placeholder)*  
  Reserved for prioritization frameworks and templates (e.g. value vs effort, RICE) that connect strategy to backlog decisions.

Typical flow: **Product-Strategy → OKR → Roadmap → Personas → PRD → Delivery**.
