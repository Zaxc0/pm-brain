## 2.1 – Strategy Methods Overview

This domain contains the core strategy methods you use to set direction, translate it into plans, and specify work.

**Before using any strategy framework:**
1. **Braindump first** – Dump your thoughts, concerns, and ideas about the strategic challenge
2. **Use your product sense** – What does your gut tell you? What feels right or wrong?
3. **Think critically** – Challenge your assumptions. What biases might be affecting your view?
4. **Reflect** – After using frameworks, reflect on what you learned and how your thinking evolved

- **2.1.1-Product-Strategy**  
  Sets strategic direction. Use this when you need to go from vision → 3–5 strategic pillars, with clear non-goals and rationale. Includes full guide + working templates (strategy sprint, strategy doc, rollout plan, leadership interviews, etc.).

- **2.1.2-OKR**  
  Operationalizes strategy into Objectives and Key Results. Use this to design OKRs, evaluate them (includes evaluation framework), and connect them back to strategic pillars.

- **2.1.3-Roadmap**  
  Turns strategy and OKRs into a time-phased plan. Use this to define NOW/NEXT/LATER, evaluate roadmap health (includes evaluation framework), and communicate plans.

- **2.1.4-PRD**  
  Specifies what to build. Use this to write product requirements (classic and JTBD-flavoured PRDs) once a problem/opportunity is validated.

- **2.1.5-Personas**  
  Describes who you’re building for. Use this to define personas and templates that connect directly to your product strategy and roadmap.

- **2.1.6-North-Star**  
  Define and maintain your north-star metric and supporting metric tree. Use this to align teams around a single metric that captures customer value.

- **2.1.7-Prioritization**  
  Prioritization frameworks and templates (RICE, ICE, Effort-Impact, Value-Complexity) that connect strategy to backlog decisions.

Typical flow: **Product-Strategy → OKR → Roadmap → Personas → PRD → Delivery**.
