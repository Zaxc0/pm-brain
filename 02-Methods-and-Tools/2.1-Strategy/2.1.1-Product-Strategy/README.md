# Product Strategy Framework

## Introduction

Use these guides and templates to develop comprehensive product strategies from discovery through execution. Product strategy bridges mission/vision to actionable plans through 3-5 strategic pillars, explicit non-goals, and clear rationale.

**When to use product strategy:**
- Teams are confused about project priorities
- Debates are circular without clear direction
- Disconnect between vision and roadmap decisions
- Need to align teams around strategic choices

**When strategy might not be needed:**
- Very small teams with clear, shared direction
- One-off projects with fixed scope
- Technical infrastructure work with no strategic choices

## Files
- `quickstart.md` — Abbreviated version for rapid strategy creation (8-12 weeks)
- `full-guide.md` — Complete product strategy development process

### Templates
- `2.1.2-templates/competitive-heatmap.md` — Market positioning analysis template
- `2.1.2-templates/design-sprint-brief.md` — Design sprint planning template
- `2.1.2-templates/leadership-interview-guide.md` — Stakeholder interview questions
- `2.1.2-templates/pillar-scorecard.md` — Strategy pillar evaluation framework
- `2.1.2-templates/rollout-plan.md` — Implementation planning template
- `2.1.2-templates/strategy-doc.md` — Comprehensive strategy documentation
- `2.1.2-templates/strategy-sprint.md` — Sprint-based strategy development
- `2.1.2-templates/working-group-charter.md` — Team charter and responsibilities

## How to Use This Framework

1. **Choose Guide**: Start with `quickstart.md` for rapid strategy or `full-guide.md` for comprehensive planning
2. **Form Working Group**: Assemble PM, Engineering, Design, and Data leads
3. **Use Templates**: Structure your work using templates in `2.1.2-templates/`
4. **Conduct Strategy Sprint**: Follow the 1-week sprint process to develop pillars
5. **Operationalize**: Map pillars to OKRs and seed roadmap with supporting initiatives

## How to Maintain

- **After Strategy Cycle**: Update company strategy document with new pillars
- **Quarterly Reviews**: Assess whether strategic pillars are still relevant
- **Annual Reviews**: Complete strategy refresh (typically every 1-2 years)
- **After Major Changes**: Update when market conditions or company direction significantly change
