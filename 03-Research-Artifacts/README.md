# Research Artifacts

## Introduction

This directory stores research outputs and artifacts from discovery activities. This is **storage for research results**, not a process framework. Use the discovery methods in `../02-Methods-and-Tools/2.3-Discovery/` to conduct research, then store your outputs here.

**This is for:** Storing research artifacts, interview notes, synthesis outputs, and research findings  
**This is NOT:** A process framework or sequential step in product development

## How This Relates to Frameworks

**Research Process (Use Frameworks):**
- Conduct interviews using discovery guides in `../02-Methods-and-Tools/2.3-Discovery/2.3.1-Research-Interviews/`
- Synthesize patterns using discovery steps in `../02-Methods-and-Tools/2.3-Discovery/2.3.2-Continuous-Discovery-Habits/`
- Create opportunities using discovery frameworks in `../02-Methods-and-Tools/2.3-Discovery/2.3.2-Continuous-Discovery-Habits/3-create-opportunities.md`

**Research Storage (This Directory):**
- Store interview notes and transcripts
- Archive synthesis outputs and patterns
- Keep research findings and insights
- Maintain research history and learnings

**Difference from 04-Initiatives:**
- **This directory (03)**: Archive for completed research outputs (transcripts, snapshots, synthesis documents)
- **04-Initiatives**: Active workspace where you plan research, document opportunities, and work on initiatives
- Research planning and opportunity assessments happen in 04; completed research artifacts are stored here in 03

## Directory Structure

```
03-Research-Artifacts/
  ├── 3.1-User-Interviews/         # Interview notes, transcripts, insights
  ├── 3.2-Qualitative-Research/    # Qualitative findings and analysis
  └── [Future research categories] # Add as needed
```

## How to Use This Directory

1. **Before Conducting Research**: Review the interview guide in `../02-Methods-and-Tools/2.3-Discovery/2.3.1-Research-Interviews/` for principles and best practices
2. **After Conducting Research**: Store outputs from discovery frameworks here
3. **Organize by Research Type**: Use subdirectories to organize different research activities
4. **Link from Initiatives**: Reference research artifacts in your initiative folders (`../04-Initiatives/`)
5. **Maintain Research History**: Keep historical research for future reference

## Quick start: self-quiz + AI collaboration for research artifacts

Use this prompt when you’ve done research (or are about to) and want help organizing artifacts in this folder:

```markdown
Act as a research archivist and synthesis partner. Help me store and structure my research artifacts in `03-Research-Artifacts/`.

1) Ask me:
- What kind of work I just did or plan to do (e.g. user interviews, usability tests, discovery calls, synthesis workshop).
- Which initiative or problem this research belongs to (if any).

2) Based on my answer:
- Suggest where to put things under `03-Research-Artifacts/` (e.g. `3.1-User-Interviews/`, `3.2-Qualitative-Research/`, or a new `[Future research category]`).
- Propose a simple folder/file structure for this study (e.g. `/notes`, `/transcripts`, `/snapshots`, `/synthesis`).
- Offer to help convert my raw notes into snapshots or synthesis summaries, and suggest links back to `04-Initiatives/` and `02-Methods-and-Tools/2.3-Discovery/`.

3) At the end of each pass:
- List: (a) which files we created/updated under `03-Research-Artifacts/`, (b) which initiative(s) they should be linked from, and (c) any open questions or follow-up research ideas.

I'll start by telling you what research I just did or am planning to do.

## How to Maintain

- **After Each Research Activity**: Store outputs in appropriate subdirectory
- **Link to Initiatives**: Reference research artifacts in opportunity assessments and PRDs
- **Quarterly Reviews**: Archive old research and extract key learnings
- **Version Control**: Track research changes in git
