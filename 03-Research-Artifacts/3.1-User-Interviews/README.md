# 3.1 – User Interviews

This folder is for storing artifacts from **user and stakeholder interviews**, not for running the interview process itself.

Use discovery methods in `../02-Methods-and-Tools/2.3-Discovery/` (especially `2.3.1-Research-Interviews/` and `2.3.2-Continuous-Discovery-Habits/`) to plan and conduct interviews, then archive the outputs here.

## Suggested structure

```text
03-Research-Artifacts/3.1-User-Interviews/
  [study-or-initiative-code]/
    notes/          # Raw notes from calls or sessions
    transcripts/    # Full transcripts (if available)
    snapshots/      # Structured interview snapshots (e.g. from 2.3.2-Continuous-Discovery-Habits)
    synthesis/      # Thematic synthesis, patterns, and insights
    assets/         # Optional: screenshots, diagrams, etc. (non-sensitive)
```

You can adapt or simplify this structure to match your workflow.

## How to use this folder

1. **Create a subfolder per study/initiative** (e.g. `onboarding-v1/`, `pricing-discovery-2025Q1/`).  
2. **Drop raw artifacts** (notes, transcripts) into the appropriate subfolders.  
3. **Store structured outputs** (snapshots, synthesis docs) after using discovery methods in `02-Methods-and-Tools/2.3-Discovery/`.  
4. **Link from initiatives** in `../04-Initiatives/` so each opportunity/PRD points to its supporting interviews.  

## Maintenance

- After each round of interviews, ensure notes and snapshots are filed correctly.  
- Periodically review older interview folders, extract key reusable insights, and archive or compress older raw data if needed.
