# 3.1 – User Interviews

This folder is for storing artifacts from **user and stakeholder interviews**, not for running the interview process itself.

Use discovery methods in [02-Methods-and-Tools/2.2-Discovery/](../../02-Methods-and-Tools/2.2-Discovery/README.md) (especially [2.2.1-Research-Interviews/](../../02-Methods-and-Tools/2.2-Discovery/2.2.1-Research-Interviews/README.md) and [2.2.2-Continuous-Discovery-Habits/](../../02-Methods-and-Tools/2.2-Discovery/2.2.2-Continuous-Discovery-Habits/README.md)) to plan and conduct interviews, then archive the analysis outputs here.

## Suggested structure

```text
03-Research-Artifacts/3.1-User-Interviews/
  [study-or-initiative-code]/
    snapshots/      # Structured interview snapshots (markdown docs)
    synthesis/      # Thematic synthesis, patterns, and insights (markdown docs)
    analysis.md     # Key findings and insights document
    links.md        # Links to external raw data (transcripts, recordings in Google Drive/SharePoint/Teams)
    assets/         # Optional: screenshots, diagrams, etc. (non-sensitive, small files only)
```

**Storage pattern:**
- **In this repo**: Analysis documents (snapshots, synthesis, insights) as markdown files
- **External (Google Drive/SharePoint/Teams)**: Raw transcripts, audio/video recordings, large note files — link to these in `links.md` or your analysis doc

You can adapt or simplify this structure to match your workflow.

## How to use this folder

1. **Create a subfolder per study/initiative** (e.g. `onboarding-v1/`, `pricing-discovery-2025Q1/`).  
2. **Save analysis as documents**: Create markdown files for interview snapshots, synthesis summaries, key insights, patterns (use discovery methods in [02-Methods-and-Tools/2.2-Discovery/](../../02-Methods-and-Tools/2.2-Discovery/README.md)).  
3. **Store raw data externally**: Store transcripts, recordings, large note files in Google Drive, SharePoint, Teams, or similar — **link to these sources** in your analysis doc or a `links.md` file.  
4. **Link from initiatives** in `../04-Initiatives/` so each opportunity/PRD points to its supporting interviews.  

## Maintenance

- After each round of interviews, **save analysis as a document** (snapshots, synthesis, insights) and ensure links to external raw data are current.  
- Periodically review older interview folders, extract key reusable insights, and verify external links are still accessible.
