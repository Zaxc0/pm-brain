# Company Context

This directory contains the foundational company context documents that provide strategic direction, organizational structure, and product principles. These documents serve as the source of truth for company-wide product and technology strategy.

## Overview

These documents should be the outcome of actual strategic work and organizational planning. The placeholder content should be replaced with your company's actual information developed through proper processes.

## Document Structure

The documents are numbered in a logical flow that follows the strategic planning and execution process:

### 1. Vision → 2. Strategy → 3. Principles → 4. Portfolio → 5. Roadmap → 6. Stakeholders

**Why this order?**
- **Vision** (1) provides the foundational "why" - mission, vision, and values that everything else builds upon
- **Strategy** (2) defines the "what" - strategic priorities and initiatives that execute the vision
- **Principles** (3) establishes the "how" - core principles that guide all product work
- **Portfolio** (4) documents "what exists" - current products and customer segments
- **Roadmap** (5) plans the "when" - execution timeline that brings strategy to life
- **Stakeholders** (6) identifies the "who" - organizational context for all activities

This structure creates a natural flow: **Why → What → How → What Exists → When → Who**

## Quick start: self-quiz + AI collaboration for company context

Use this prompt when you want to **(re)build your company context** and aren’t sure where to start:

```markdown
Act as a product strategy coach helping me build a minimal but useful company context (vision, strategy, principles, portfolio, roadmap, stakeholders).

1) First, help me locate my starting point:
- Ask what’s most clear today (vision, strategy, principles, products, roadmap, stakeholders) and what feels fuzzy.
- Based on my answers, propose 1–2 starting documents under `01-Company-Context/` to work on next:
  - 1-company-vision.md
  - 2-company-strategy.md
  - 3-company-product-principles.md
  - 4-company-product-explanation.md
  - 5-company-roadmap.md
  - 6-company-stakeholders.md

2) For the chosen document:
- Ask me to paste any existing notes, slides, or docs.
- Draft an updated version using the structure in that file, clearly marking [placeholders] and [open questions].
- Suggest which related methods in `02-Methods-and-Tools/` I should use next (e.g. Product Strategy, OKR, Roadmap, Personas).

3) At the end of each pass:
- Summarize the updated company context in 3–5 bullets.
- Propose the next 1–2 `01-Company-Context` documents to refine, and which `02-Methods-and-Tools` frameworks to use alongside them.

I'll start by telling you which parts of our company context feel most unclear right now.
```

## Maintenance

- **Quarterly Reviews**: Review all documents quarterly for accuracy and relevance
- **After Major Changes**: Update relevant documents when strategy, org structure, or priorities change
- **Version Control**: Use git to track changes and maintain history
- **Stakeholder Updates**: Update stakeholder directory when org changes occur
